        My career began as a sales engineer and drafter in manufacturing,
        generating proposals, and maintaining engineering standards. Then, the
        company I worked for asked me to create a website for them. I had my own
        small business designing and implementing websites since college; what
        started as a hobby eventually became my career. I think my engineering
        background is perhaps my most important strength in that, at its core,
        all engineering is a recursive loop of strategic planning and data
        analytics with the ultimate goal of solving a complex problem by
        breaking it down into manageable pieces while continuously improving
        processes.

        I have a coderâ€™s spirit, but because of my extensive non-coding skills
        and abilities, I ended up in several stakeholder or client-facing roles.
        Since my time as a writing tutor in high school, I have always
        gravitated towards writing and mentoring tasks. I have an exceptional
        technical writing ability which helps my written communications be clear
        and concise while managing a project or team.

        My experience as an AutoCAD drafter and graphic designer have made me
        deft at generating visual aids, like flowcharts, when training staff or
        evangelizing a proposal. My greatest strength is being able to
        communicate well with both technical and business-leaning colleagues. I
        am a skilled instructor who has the patience and people skills to pass
        on my knowledge to others. Because my leadership skills are rooted in
        the concept of leading by example, I can inspire those around me to
        great success.
